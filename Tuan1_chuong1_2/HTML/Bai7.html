    Some smiles include a contraction of the muscles at the corner of the eyes, an action known as a Duchenne smile. 
    Among humans, a smile expresses delight, sociability, happiness, joy, or amusement. 
    It is distinct from a similar but usually involuntary expression of anxiety known as a grimace. 
    Although cross-cultural studies have shown that smiling is a means of communication throughout the world,[1] 
    there are large differences among different cultures, religions, and societies, with some using smiles to convey confusion or embarrassment.</p>
