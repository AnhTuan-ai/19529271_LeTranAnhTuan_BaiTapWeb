        <h1>CSS CUA BAI 7</h1>
        <div class="container">
                    <p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) allows you to create great-looking web pages,
                    but how does it work under the hood? This article explains what CSS is with
                    a simple syntax example and also covers some key terms about the language.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>In the Introduction to HTML module, we covered what HTML is and how it is used
                        to mark up documents. These documents will be readable in a web browser.
                        Headings will look larger than regular text, paragraphs break onto a new 
                        line and have space between them. Links are colored and underlined to distinguish 
                        them from the rest of the text. What you are seeing are the browser's default styles — very
                        basic styles — that the browser applies to HTML to make sure that the page will be basically 
                        readable even if no explicit styling is specified by the author of the page.</p>
