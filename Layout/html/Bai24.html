            Baked goods have been around for thousands of years. 
            The art of baking was developed early during the Roman Empire. 
            It was a highly famous art as Roman citizens loved baked goods
            and demanded them frequently for important occasions such as 
            feasts and weddings. Because of the fame of the art of baking, 
            around 300 BC, baking was introduced as an occupation and 
            respectable profession for Romans. Bakers began to prepare bread 
            at home in an oven, using mills to grind grain into flour for their 
            breads. The demand for baked goods persisted, and the first bakers' 
            guild was established in 168 BC in Rome. The desire for baked goods 
            promoted baking throughout Europe and expanded into eastern parts 
            of Asia. Bakers started baking bread and other goods at home and 
            selling them on the streets.

            This trend became common, and soon, baked products were sold in 
            streets of Rome, Germany, London, and more. A system of delivering 
            baked goods to households arose as the demand increased significantly. 
            This prompted bakers to establish places where people could purchase 
            baked goods. The first open-air market for baked goods was established 
            in Paris, and since then bakeries have become a common place to purchase 
            delicious goods and to socialize. By the colonial era, bakeries were 
            commonly viewed in this way.[2]

        Old methods of baking were almost completely eradicated when these 
        new methods were introduced and the industry became industrialised.
        The old methods were seen as unnecessary and financially unsound. 
        During this period there were not many traditional bakeries left
