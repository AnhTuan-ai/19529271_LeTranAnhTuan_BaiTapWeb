                <p>In the Introduction to HTML module, we covered what HTML is and how it is used
                    to mark up documents. These documents will be readable in a web browser.
                    Headings will look larger than regular text, paragraphs break onto a new 
                    line and have space between them. Links are colored and underlined to distinguish 
                    them from the rest of the text. What you are seeing are the browser's default styles — very
                    basic styles — that the browser applies to HTML to make sure that the page will be basically 
                    readable even if no explicit styling is specified by the author of the page.</p>
